JE12: Studies with a discontinuous Galerkin Poisson bracket solver
==================================================================

In this entry I study a discontinuous Galerkin (DG) algorithm to
discretize the Poisson bracket operator. In particular, I look at the
spatial and temporal convergence properties of this algorithm and use
it in combination with the finite-element (FE) Poisson solver to
construct a solver for the 2D incompressible Euler equations written
in streamfunction-vorticity form.
