JE9: Tunneling through an electron-cyclotron cutoff layer
=========================================================

In this note I study the propagation of an radio-frequency (RF) wave
into a electron-cyclotron cutoff layer. As in the plasma beach
problem, the ions are assumed to be stationary and are not
evolved. The plasma is initialized with a uniform density and is
threaded with a non-uniform static transverse field. This static field
exerts a Lorentz force on the electrons but is not evolved or included
in the electric field update equations. What this means physically is
that the static field is assumed to be created from a set of external
coils and hence its curl is zero. Note that in reality the selected
static field need not satisfy this constraint, making the problem
setup a bit inconsistent.
