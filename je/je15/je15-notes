In the results shown above the simulation domain was comparable to the
Debye length. In this case the damping rate is strongly enhanced from
the expected values from standard linear-analysis. In C. Villani's
`course notes
<http://math.univ-lyon1.fr/~villani/Cedrif/pre.Landau.pdf>`_, see
section 3 in Chapter 3, it is stated that "... the Landau damping rate
in a periodic box of length :math:`l` decays extremely fast with
:math:`l`, like :math:`\exp(-c/l^2)`." Hence, to verify results with
linear theory one needs to increase the size of the domain.
