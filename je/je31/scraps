Convergence of corrections with time-step
-----------------------------------------

The anti-limiter caps the extrapolated values to :math:`1/\sigma`,
where the CFL number :math:`\sigma` is proportional to :math:`\Delta
t`. Hence, reducing the time-step will reduce the amount of sub-cell
diffusion corrections that are needed as the extra enhancements with
maintain slope bounds better. To test this, we ran the square-top-hat
simulation with :math:`1/2` and :math:`1/4` of the time-step. The
ratio of the corrections, :math:`\Delta f`, to the smallest time-step
values are shown below. As is clear, the errors reduce linearly with
:math:`1/\Delta t`, consistent with the amount of enhancement added by
the anti-limiter.

  Ratio of sub-cell diffusion corrections, :math:`\Delta f` as a
  function of time. The amount of correction needed reduces as the
  time-step is reduced, consistent with the property that the amount
  of enhancement allowed increases as the time-step is reduced.
