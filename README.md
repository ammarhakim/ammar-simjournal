This is a collection of input files and notes that make up my "Simulation Journal". The input files are from Gkeyll 1.0 and 2.0. These are very comprehensive set of input files that test almost all aspects of the Gkeyll 1.0 and 2.0 code. 

Please see my [Simulation Journal](http://ammar-hakim.org/sj/) where some of the tests are documented. Not all tests are documented there.

*I do not claim that all these files will work as often the code undergoes some changes that are not backward compatible.
However, most input files (> 99%) should work with minor (if any) edits.*
