This is a collection of input files and notes that make up my "Simulation Journal". The input files are from Gkeyll 1.0 and 2.0
I do not claim that all these files will work as often the code undergoes some changes that are not backward compatible.
However, most input files (> 99%) should work with minor (if any) edits.
