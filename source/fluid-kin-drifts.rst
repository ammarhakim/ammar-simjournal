Mirror force, drifts and a simplified gyrokinetic/fluid model in 1D
-------------------------------------------------------------------

In this note I derive parallel and perpendicular components of the
exact momentum equation and discuss the mirror force and various
drifts that are contained in the collisionless system. I also list a
simplified 1x2v kinetic model of plasma along a field line and take
its moments.
