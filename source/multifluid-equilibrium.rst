Multifluid flowing equilibrium equations
========================================

This note contains a derivation of multifluid flowing equilibrium
equations. It is here only as a reference but these equations have not
been implemented in Gkeyll or, for that matter, in any publicly
available code that I am aware of. I might be wrong though. Perhaps
more useful are some of the "Useful Identities" in the Appendix A.
