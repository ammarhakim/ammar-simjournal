# Simulations building up to Mercury magnetosphere

This series of simulations builds up to a full Mercury
magnetopshere. We are approching this systematically to make sure we
understand every step and can figure out when things break.

- m1: Neutral Euler simulation of 2D fluid flow around Mercury. This
  simply demos the capability of getting a bow shock over the planet
  modelled as a solid cylinder.
