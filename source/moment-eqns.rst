Moment equations and multi-species BGK and LBO operators
--------------------------------------------------------

In this note I list the general moment equations, both in primitive as
well as conservative forms. I also show the specific case of ten- and
five-moments equations. Moments of the multi-species BGK and LBO
operators are also derived. This is all relatively straightforward
stuff but I just want to have it in one place for my own reference.
