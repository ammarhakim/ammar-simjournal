Metric and symplectic geometry
------------------------------

In this note I list some useful information about metric and
symplectic geometry that allow easily transform various equations,
including Hamiltonian systems, to arbitrary coordinate systems. I keep
forgetting all this material and end up rederiving all expressions
repeatedly when I need them. These notes are just a personal reminder
to the things I forget. Hopefully, others will find the notes useful
also.
