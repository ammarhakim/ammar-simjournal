# Coupled Hasegawa-Wakatani simulations

o1: Old-style input file. This works, but probably not a good idea to prerpetuate

f1: Single domain simulation, new style input file
f2: Same as f1, but with fixed time-step

c1: Coupled version of f1
c2: Same as c1, but with fixed time-step
c3: Same as c2, but with 10% noise
