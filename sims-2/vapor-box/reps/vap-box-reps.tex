\title{Premiminary results from fluid simulations of Vapor Box divertor}

\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
  \noindent Some \emph{very} preliminary results from invicid Euler
  simulations of vapor box divertor concept are presented.
\end{abstract}

\section{Notes on boundary conditions}

At present, the boundary conditions are applied using ``ghost
cells''. I.e. the vapor quantities in the cell just outside the domain
are held fixed to the values computed from the evaporation formula
which depends on the wall temperature\footnote{P. Browning and
  P.E. Potter, ``AN ASSESSMENT OF THE EXPERIMENTALLY DETERMINED VAPOUR
  PRESSURES OF THE LIQUID ALKALI METALS'', in the \emph{Handbook of
    Thermodynamic and Transport Properties of Alkali Metals},
  R.W. Ohse, Ed., 1985}. In the code, this is implemented as:
\begin{verbatim}
function vaporPressure(Twall)
   return math.exp(26.89-18880/Twall-0.4942*math.log(Twall))
end
\end{verbatim}
Once pressure is determined, the number density is computed assuming
that the evaporated vapor is at the same temperature as the wall
% \footnote{It is possible that these BCs are not quite correct. We have
%   computed fluxes based on drifting Maxwellians also, but these are
%   harder to implement. Eventually, I plan to use the flux BCs (rather
%   than the current ghost BCs) exclusively.}.

\section{Notes on equations and solver}

We are solving the standard invicid Navier-Stokes equations (Euler
equations). These are written in conservation law form (in 1D)
\begin{align}
  \frac{\partial}{\partial{t}}
  \left[
    \begin{matrix}
      \rho \\
      \rho u \\
      \rho v \\
      \rho w \\
      E
    \end{matrix}
  \right]
  +
  \frac{\partial}{\partial{x}}
  \left[
    \begin{matrix}
      \rho u \\
      \rho u^2 + p \\
      \rho uv \\
      \rho uw \\
      (E+p)u
    \end{matrix}
  \right]
  =
  0
\end{align}
Extension to higher dimensions is obvious. Here
\begin{align}
  E = \rho \varepsilon + \frac{1}{2}\rho q^2  
\end{align}
is the total energy and $\varepsilon$ is the internal energy of the
fluid and $q^2=u^2 + v^2 + w^2$. The pressure is given by an equation
of state (EOS) $p=p(\varepsilon, \rho)$. For an ideal gas the EOS is
$p = (\gamma-1)\rho \varepsilon$. The specific enthalpy is defined as
$h = (E+p)/\rho$, and is used in constructing numerical fluxes at cell
interfaces\footnote{For details on this please see
  \url{http://ammar-hakim.org/sj/euler-eigensystem.html}}. I am using
ideal gas EOS for now, but this could be replaced later if
needed\footnote{If we expect a mixture of atomic/diatomic Lithium we
  may want to generate EOS tables and use them instead.}.

To solve these equations I am using a robust, second-order,
shock-capturing finite-volume scheme, which has been benchmarked very
carefully on dozens of difficult problems.\footnote{See
  \url{http://ammar-hakim.org/sj/je/je2/je2-euler-shock.html} for 1D
  shock tests,
  \url{http://ammar-hakim.org/sj/je/je22/je22-euler-2d.html} for 2D
  tests and \url{http://ammar-hakim.org/sj/je/je23/je23-euler-3d.html}
  for 3D tests.}.


% \section{Chain of two boxes}

% To get some insight into the flow I have setup a chain of 2
% boxes. Each box is $0.4\times 0.4$~m and the slot connecting them is
% $10$~cm wide, with a $10$~cm length. The left box walls are held to a
% fixed temperature of $950^o$~C and the right box to $300^o$~C. Note
% that baffles are held to the same temperature as the wall. The
% simulation is run to steady-state. Profiles along the centerline of
% the vapor box are shown below.

\section{Chain of five boxes: Lithium covered baffles}

I ran a five-box chain simulation to steady state. Each box is
$0.4\times 0.4$~m and the slot connecting them is $10$~cm wide, with a
$10$~cm length. Each box walls (including baffles) are held at a fixed
temperature, as specified in Rob's paper. The simulation is run to
steady-state. Profiles of various quantities are shown below.

    above figure. See {\tt vapor\-box/s6} for input file.}

\section{Chain of five boxes: Equilibriated (reflecting) baffles}

I ran a five-box chain simulation to steady state. Each box is
$0.4\times 0.4$~m and the slot connecting them is $10$~cm wide, with a
$10$~cm length. Each box wall is held at a fixed temperature, as
specified in Rob's paper. The baffles are assumed to be in equilibrium
with the vapor impinging on them, and are hence treated as perfect
reflectors\footnote{The flux in the normal direction on the baffles is
  set to zero, and the fluid is allowed to slip tangentially,
  consistent with the invicid approximation.}. The simulation is run to
steady-state. Profiles of various quantities are shown below.

The key difference between the Lithium covered and equilibrated
baffles cases is the formation of a standing shock just behind each
baffle. This happens as the vapor reflects off the wall, increasing
back-pressure and eventually forming a standing shock a few
centimeters behind each baffle.
