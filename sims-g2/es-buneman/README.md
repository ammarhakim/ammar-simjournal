EM simulations of the ES Buneman instability. In these simulations a
"ghost" current is added to ensure that the plasma does not develop a
inductive electric field to cancel out the electron current.

All simulations use p=2 Serendipity basis.

- b1: Mass ratio 25
- b2: Mass ratio 50
- b3: Mass ratio 100
- b4: Mass ratio 200
- b5: Mass ratio 400
- b6: Mass ratio 1836.2
- b7: Mass ratio 40*1836.2 (Argon)

- n1: Nonlinear run with mass-ratio 25
- n6: Nonlinear run with mass-ratio 1836.2

- c1: Same as n1, except with small amounts of collisions

The following don't seem to work properly at present

- f1: Fluid sim corresponding to n1

- w1: Same as b1, except ion and electron thermal speeds are same.
