## Tests for cross-species LBO collisions

# Neutral species collisions

- n1: Two species, Sod shock. 1x1v (Collisions: n1<->n2)
- n2: BGK version of n1. (MFP is 3x smaller)
- n3: Same as n1, except 2V problem
- n4: Same as n1, except 3V problem
- n5: Stationary shock 1x1v (Collisions: n1<->n2)
- n6: Stationary shock 1x2v
- n7: Stationary shock 1x3v

- e1: Exact Euler RP solution corresponding to n1
- e3: Exact Euler RP solution corresponding to n3
- e4: Exact Euler RP solution corresponding to n4
