Tests for an iterative solver for Poisson solver
================================================

Iterative solver for Poisson equations with Super-Time-Stepping (STS)
scheme.

STS RKL2 Tests
--------------

Each directory contains two runs, with and without extrapolation.

- s1: 32x32, RKL2 tests
- s2: 64x64, RKL2 tests
- s3: 128x128, RKL2 tests

STS RKL1 Tests
--------------

This is the 'm' series of tests corresponding to the 's' series of
simulations.
