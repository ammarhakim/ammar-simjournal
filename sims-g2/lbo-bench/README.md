Input files for benchmarking the FOP (LBO version). Used in the FPO
paper.

- r1: Relaxation of step function to Maxwellian. p=1 case
- r2: Relaxation of step function to Maxwellian. p=2 case
- r3: Same as r1, except CFL factor of 2x smaller
- r4: Same as r1, except 2x more cells in V (entropy convergence comparison)
