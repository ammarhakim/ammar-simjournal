Valsov for test-particle simulations

#c1 Constant electric field (quad potential case)

#c2 Time-dependent, but uniform electric field with constant magnetic
field. w=0.5

#c3 Time-dependent, but uniform electric field with constant magnetic
field. w=1.0 (Resonant case)

#c4. Time- and spatially-dependent electric field with constant
 magnetic field. E0=0.5

#c5. Time- and spatially-dependent electric field with constant
 magnetic field. E0=0.95

#c6. Time- and spatially-dependent electric field with constant
 magnetic field. E0=0.6

Self-consistent versions are in the sN directories, and correspond to
the test-distribution versions.
