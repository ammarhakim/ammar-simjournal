Multi-fluid and kinetic simulations of EM Riemann problem. This is
repeating the classic Riemann problem to put into a paper as a
benchmark and to study the details of the waves and, with the kinetic
code, the various damping mechanism present. The domain size is also
much bigger as it seems that the boundaries are impacting the
solution.

- t1: 5m, q=1; 2000 cells on [-2,2] domain
- t2: 5m, q=10; 8000 cells ... 
- t3: 5m, q=100; 8000 cells ...
- t3-1: 5m, q=100; 8000 cells; lots of output frames
- t4: 5m, q=1000; 12000 cells ..
- t5: 5m, q=1000; 4000 cells on [-1/2, 1/2]
