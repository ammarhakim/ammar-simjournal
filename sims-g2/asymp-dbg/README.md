Analysis of scheme when spatial and/or temporal scales are
under-resolved.

- r1: Uniform flow with perturbed field; 256x256 grid. Base case,
  CFL=0.5, limiters and 1D variation in X only
- r2: Uniform flow with perturbed field; 256x256 grid. Base case,
  CFL=0.5, limiters and 1D variation in Y only
