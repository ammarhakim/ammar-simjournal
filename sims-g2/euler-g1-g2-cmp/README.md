Tests to compare results and timing of Euler solver between G1 and G2.

"s" series of simulations are from G1 and "g" series from G2. "g"
series sims are not listed below.


- s1: 1D Sod shock on 1024 grid.
- s2: 2D Riemann problem on 400x400 grid
- s3: 3D Spherical Riemann problem on 75x75x50 grid
- s4: 3D Vorticity generated by shock problem
- s5: 3D Vorticity generated by shock problem (smaller grid)

Convergence study (the corresponding G2 input files use the
PlasmaOnCartGrid App object)

- s6: 2D periodic box sim for convergence testing
- s7: Same as s6 but with 50x50 grid
- s8: Same as s6 but with 100x100 grid
- s9: Same as s6 but with 200x200 grid
