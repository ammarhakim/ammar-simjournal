Linear dispersion solver test

Isothermal tests
----------------

- iso-1: Cold plasma waves; transverse propagation
- iso-2: Buneman instability, mi/me = 25
- iso-3: Buneman instability, mi/me = 200
- iso-4: Buneman instability, mi/me = 1836.2

5m tests
--------

- 5m-1: Same as iso-1, except with 5M model. Finite temperature (T = 0.1)

10m tests
---------

- 10m-1: Same as iso-1, except with 10M model. Finite temperature (T = 0.1)
