SimJournal: Ammar's Simulation Journal
======================================

Computational science is often hampered by the inability to
independently reproduce or verify published research. In fact, the
problem is worse: often one can not even reproduce ones own results
after a short period of time. A small step towards reproducibility is
to maintain a "simulation journal". The journal entries should
document a set of related simulations, providing enough detail to
allow a reader to understand the problem, algorithms used and
results. See `JE0 <je/je0.html>`_ below for details.

The following entries are my attempt to maintain a simulation journal,
mainly for my own use. This allows me to keep notes in one place and
refer to them while writing papers or making presentations.
