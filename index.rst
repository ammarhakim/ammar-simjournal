SimJournal: Ammar Hakim's Simulation Journal
============================================

Below are a list of journal entries, documenting various problems that
have been attempted with Gkeyll. The eventual goal of Gkeyll is to
solve the gyrokinetic equations in the edge region of tokamaks,
including the scrap-off-layer. However, Gkeyll provides a powerful
framework to study various physics problems as well as test different
algorithms in a modular way. Some of these are documented below, with
links to the Lua scripts to run those problems.
