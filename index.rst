SimJournal: Ammar Hakim's Simulation Journal
============================================

  It is useless to be impatient with the work that must be done.

Computational science is often hampered by the inability to
independently reproduce or verify published research. In fact, the
problem is worse: often we can not even reproduce our own results
after a short period of time. A small step towards reproducibility is
to maintain a "simulation journal". The journal entries should
document a set of related simulations, providing enough detail to
allow a reader to understand the problem, algorithms used and
results. See `JE0 <je/je0.html>`_ below for details.

The following entries are my attempt to maintain a simulation journal,
mainly for my own use. This allows me to keep notes in one place and
refer to them while writing papers or making presentations. 

Writing *systematic* entries is a tedious and difficult job as it
forces us to carefully document the problem, the scripts/programs and
the results. However, it is a task that *must* be done if
computational physics is to qualify as a true science and not just a
means of generating pretty, but irreproducible, pictures.
